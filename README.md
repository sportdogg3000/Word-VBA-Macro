# Word-VBA-Macro
I am creating a word form that has multiple sections. 
I would like to have these sections hidden (collapsed) or expanded based on what the user checks in the checkbox. 
Example below is a question within the form.
If the user answers "Yes," I would like the next section titled "Client Software Package" to appear.
If the user answers "No," I would want that section to be hidden. 
1) I would need a macro that hides this section 
2) How can I assign this macro to a legacy tool like a checkbox from the Word Developer tab  
"Does the client have a software package with us?"  
YES NO  

Client Software Package 
List the name of the software. 
List the version of the software. 
How long has the client had this software  


Thanks! Jimmy
